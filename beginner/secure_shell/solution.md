# Secure Shell

The <a href="https://secureshell.wwctf.com/">challenge</a> is website where we can enter Shell commands to execute. However, apparently not all commands are available when I tested a a few commands as `ls`, `echo`, `pwd` seemed to be the only "secure" commands while the rest would trigger an error.<br/><br/>

Using `ls`, the web showed the current directory had file `index.php` - the website we were at.
